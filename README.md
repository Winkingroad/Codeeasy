# Collaborative Code Editor using MERN Stack with Websockets

**Welcome to our Collaborative Code Editor project**, an ongoing venture aimed at creating a real-time collaborative coding experience using the powerful MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). This project is not just about code; it's about fostering collaboration and making coding a shared and interactive experience.

## Features (Ongoing Development)

- **Real-Time Collaboration:** Dive into the future of coding with a real-time collaborative code editor that enables multiple users to edit code simultaneously. Witness the magic of synchronized coding experiences.

- **Websockets Integration:** Harness the power of Websockets in Node.js to facilitate seamless and instantaneous synchronization of code changes across users. Experience the thrill of coding together in real-time.

- **CodeMirror Brilliance:** Enjoy the convenience of integrated CodeMirror, offering advanced code highlighting and editing capabilities. Elevate your coding experience with a feature-rich text editor.

- **User Authentication and MongoDB Integration:** Prioritize security and data management by implementing robust user authentication and leveraging MongoDB for efficient data storage.

- **Interactive React Interface:** Immerse yourself in an interactive and user-friendly interface designed with React. Our ongoing development focuses on creating an environment that is not just productive but also enjoyable.

## Why We're Building It

In the realm of collaborative coding, we believe in breaking barriers and bringing developers together. Our Collaborative Code Editor project is driven by the vision of fostering a coding environment where collaboration is seamless, real-time, and enjoyable. Stay tuned as we continue to push the boundaries of collaborative coding, making it a shared journey for developers around the globe.
